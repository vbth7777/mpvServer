# MPV Server

This is a mini tool that allows you to interact with MPV in your terminal through a web server.

## Features:

- Provides a local web server with port 9789

- Allows you to run MPV command lines in your terminal by making POST requests.

- Supports queuing of multiple requests to the web server.

## Summary:

This tool can be combined with other tools to create your own unique toolset.

### Example:

For instance, I have combined it with SurfingKeys to easily open videos using just my keyboard with a few key presses.
